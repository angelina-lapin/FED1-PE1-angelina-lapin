## Description

The "Tech for Tomorrow" blog is a responsive web application designed for a fictional client, HotView Labs.

- **Blog Post Public Page**: Shows the post title, author, publication date, image banner, and post content from the API in a responsive layout.
- **Blog Post Edit Page**: Available only for the owner when logged in, allowing them to delete or update posts.
